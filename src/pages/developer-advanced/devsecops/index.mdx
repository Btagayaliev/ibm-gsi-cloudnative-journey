description: Security in the Container World

### Container Security 
Container security is the process of implementing security tools and policies that will give you the assurance that everything in your container is running as intended. 
This includes protecting the infrastructure, the software delivery chain, runtime, and everything in between.With this in mind, the process of securing containers is continuous. 
It should be integrated into your development process, automated to remove the number of manual touch points, and extended into the maintenance and operation of the underlying infrastructure. 
This means protecting your build pipeline container images and runtime host, platform, and application layers. 
Implementing security as part of the continuous delivery life cycle means your business will mitigate risk and reduce vulnerabilities across an ever-growing attack surface.
