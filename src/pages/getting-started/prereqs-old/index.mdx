Following steps need to be done by all participants of the workshop <Globals name="env" />

</PageDescription>

This workshop agenda assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker
, and modern software delivery techniques including CI/CD. To learn more
 about these topics, consult the educational materials listed in the Activation section 
 [Cloud Native Deployment](/activation/cloudnative-deployment).

## Create accounts

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. Use the enterprise email id as the login.

### Configure Github Personal Access Token
For your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.) to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with the GitHub organization and can be used to access any of the organization's repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token; name it something like "CI pipeline"
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a web hook

  - The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on
