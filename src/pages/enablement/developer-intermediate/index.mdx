Learning tasks for developers to understand how application development works
 with Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

Before you proceed, make sure you have an **IBM GSI Enterprise Sandbox** invite
. It enables you to access an IBM Cloud account with the [Predefined DevSecOps
 Tools](/overview/content-overview) already installed and ready for you to
  use. (The environment is locked down to prevent the creation of any
   new services outside of the scope of the learning journey)

</InlineNotification>

This set of learning tasks focuses on how to use Red Hat OpenShift Developer
 Experience to develop and deploy a set of basic cloud-native applications
 . If also covers the use of common tools designed to help the developer
  monitor, log and debug their applications.

This learning tasks assumes that you have:
 - You have completed the tasks before the workshop
 - You have received an IBM GSI Enterprise Sandbox invite email
 - Have watched the 30 min Introduction Video showing the end to end experience

### Learning Tasks

The learning tasks help you understand the Developer Experience with IBM Cloud and working with an IBM RedHat OpenShift or IBM Kubernetes managed cluster. These are the getting started and initial setup tasks that help you start a project.

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: Support is provided in the `#<slack-channel>` you were provided
 with in your IBM GSI Enterprise Sandbox invite. This channel will also be
  used to share any common issues found. It can be used to provide feedback
   on the content you have just completed

You have sucessfully completed the **Developer Intermediate** material
- You have become familar with IBM Cloud and Red Hat OpenShift
- You have deployed your first application with OpenShift 4.3
- You have understood how monitor, access logs
- Understand where your artifacts are being managed

### Review Learning Tasks

Working with colleagues review your learning tasks. The GSI team is looking for feedback from three perspectives:

- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next steps?**

Developers will begin the learning journey with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the Cloud Native enablement with a more detailed understanding of how to build solutions for the IBM Cloud. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the learning journey successfully.
