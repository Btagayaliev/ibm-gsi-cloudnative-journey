<PageDescription>

Learning tasks for developers to understand how application development works on RedHat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

Before you proceed, make sure you have an IBM GSI Sandbox invite. It enables you to access an IBM Cloud account with the [Developer Tools environment](/overview/content-overview) already installed and ready for you to use, including both a Kubernetes cluster and an OpenShift cluster. (The environment is locked down to prevent creating any new services.) Also, before proceeding:
- Install the [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](/getting-started/cli) (again) to ensure you have the latest version

</InlineNotification>

This set of learning tasks focuses on the Day 1 Developer Experience: How to use the Developer Tools environment to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. 

This learning tasks assumes that you have:
 - Reviewed the content from the Agenda: RedHat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes Fundamentals
 - Seen a demo of each of the tasks below from the Video Presentation
 
### Learning Tasks

The learning tasks help you understand the Day 1 Developer Experience with IBM Cloud and working with an IBM RedHat OpenShift or IBM Kubernetes managed cluster. These are the getting started and initial setup tasks that help you start a project.

### Review Learning Tasks

Working with colleagues review your learning tasks. The GSI team is looking for feedback from three perspectives:

- **What went well?**
- **What needs improvement?**
- **Next steps?**

Developers will begin the learning journey with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the Cloud Native enablement with a more detailed understanding of how to build solutions for the IBM Cloud. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the learning journey successfully.
