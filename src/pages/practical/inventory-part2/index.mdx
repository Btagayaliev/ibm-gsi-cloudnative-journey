[Integrating with Cloudant NoSQL Database](/practical/cloudantintegration)
## Guide

This Micro App guidance continues to build upon the microserivces that were built in the Inventory Micro App Part 1 guide. Make sure you have completed Part 1 or deployed the working [Inventory Solution](/practical/inventory-app).

In part 1, we implemented the three tiers in the Inventory Mico App and deployed the app to the `dev` namespace/project. In Part 2, we will take that app and make these additions:

- Deploy the app to the `test` namespace/project using CD techniques and ArgoCD
- Add application security using IBM Cloud App ID
- Add database persistence using IBM Cloudant

## Using CD to deploy to Test

ArgoCD is a tool that provides continuous delivery for projects and applications. If you haven't already, be sure to read
through the [Continuous Delivery with ArgoCD guide](/guides/continuous-delivery).

For this exercise, we are going to use ArgoCD to push the Inventory app from `dev` to `test` (and possibly `staging` as well). If you have already completed the Inventory Micro App, then it can be used for the ArgoCD process (although perhaps with some minor pipeline updates). If you haven't completed the exercise, you can start from the [solution repositories](/practical/inventory-app) to perform the ArgoCD steps.


### Set up the GitOps repo

Let's get started with using Argo CD.

- Create a new repo from the [ArgoCD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/template-argocd-test/generate)

- Clone the project to your machine

- Create a branch named `test`
    ```bash
    git checkout -b test
    ```
  
- Push the branch to the remote
    ```bash
    git push -u origin test
    ```
  
- Create the test namespace with the CLI by running `igc namespace test-{initials}`

### Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD

Now that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is.

- Get the ArgoCD login information from the `igc credentials` cli command

    <InlineNotification>
        Note: You need to be logged into the cluster on the command-line for the CLI to access the cluster information.
    </InlineNotification>

- Log into ArgoCD (use `igc credentials` to obtain your credentials and login to argo)

- Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

    ![ArgoCD config](/images/argocd-config.png)

- Select the `Repositories` option

- Click either the `Connect Repo using HTTPS` or `Connect Repo using SSH` button at the top and provide the information
for the GitOps repo you just created.

### Create a project in ArgoCD (Optional)

In ArgoCD terms, each deployable component is an `Application` and applications are grouped into `Projects`. Projects are not 
required for ArgoCD to be able to deploy applications but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions
on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

To create a project, do the following:

- Log into ArgoCD

- Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

    ![ArgoCD config](/images/argocd-config.png)

- Select the `Projects` option

- Click the `New Project` button at the top of the page.

- Provide the following values then press `Create`:

    - `name` - the name for the project (provide `inventory-management)
    - `description` - a brief description of the project
    - `sources` - click `add source` and pick the Git repository from the list that was added previously
    - `destinations` 
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `test-{initials}` for the namespace
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `staging-{initials}` for the namespace

    **Note:** Initially, the only cluster that is available is the one in which ArgoCD is - 
    `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. By adding the two destinations we have allowed the project to be deployed
    to both the `test-{initials}` and `staging-{initials}` namespaces within the current cluster.

### Configure the GitOps repo for Inventory Management service

- Copy the `app-artifactory` folder and give it a name that matches the Inventory Management service component 
(e.g. `inventory-management-svc-{initials}`)

- Update `inventory-management-svc-{initials}/Chart.yaml` and update the name to match the directory name

- Update `inventory-management-svc-{initials}/requirements.yaml` with the following values:

    - `name` - the name of helm chart/image. This should match the folder name
    - `version` - the version number of the helm chart
    - `repository` - the url to the helm repository including the folder where helm charts are being stored.

- here is an example
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: inventory-management-svc-mjp
      version: 1.0.0-1
      repository: http://artifactory.mooc-one-rhos-cluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/artifactory/generic-local/mooc-team-one/
    ```

    

- Run `kubectl get configmap/ibmcloud-config -n tools -o yaml` to print the configuration information
for the cluster

- In `inventory-management-svc-{initials}/values.yaml` replace `<app-chart-name>` with the directory name. Replace `ingressSubdomain` with the value from the previous step. Update `tlsSecretName` with the value from the previous step. The result should look something like the following
    ```yaml path=inventory-management-svc-{initials}/values.yaml
    global:
      ingressSubdomain: sms-test.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
      tlsSecretName: sms-test-cluster

    inventory-management-svc-{initials}:
      replicaCount: 1

      ingress:
        enabled: true
        tlsSecretName: sms-test-cluster
    ```

- Commit and push the changes
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Adds inventory-management-svc config"
    git push
    ```

### Add an application in ArgoCD for the Inventory Management service

The last step in the process is to define the application(s) within ArgoCD that should be managed. This consists of
connecting the config within the Git repo to the cluster and namespace.

- Log into ArgoCD

- Click `New Application` and provide the following values:

    - `application name` - `test-inventory-management-svc`
    - `project` - `inventory-management`
    - `sync-policy` - `Automatic`
    - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored
    - `revision` - `test`
    - `path` - `inventory-management-svc-{initials}`
    - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment
    - `destination namespace` - `test-{initials}`
    - `values file` - `values.yaml`

- Click `Create`

- Click on the newly created application. A graph of kubernetes resources should be shown
if everything is configured correctly.

### Make a change in the GitOps repo

In order to trigger a (re-)deployment we can make an update to a value in the GitOps repo and
watch ArgoCD apply the change.

- Open a terminal and navigate to your GitOps repo directory

- Be sure that you are in the `test` branch
    ```bash
    git checkout test
    ```

- Update `inventory-management-svc-{initials}/values.yaml` to increase the replica count
    ```yaml path=inventory-management-svc-{initials}/values.yaml
    global:
      ingressSubdomain: sms-test.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
      tlsSecretName: sms-test-cluster

    inventory-management-svc-{initials}:
      replicaCount: 3

      ingress:
        enabled: true
        tlsSecretName: sms-test-cluster
    ```

- Commit and push the change
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Increases replica count"
    ```

- Log into the ArgoCD UI and look at the state of the application. It should say `Synchronizing`.
If you don't want to wait you can manually by pressing the `Synchronize` button.

### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline

The last stage in the CI pipeline updates the version number in the `requirements.yaml` to the version of the helm chart
that was just built. Through a couple naming conventions the only thing the pipeline needs in order to interact
with the CD process is a kubernetes secret named `gitops-cd-secret` that provides the details needed
to connect to the git repo to push updates.

The [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) has a command that provides a helper to make the creating of a kubernetes secret
with git credentials very easy.

- Log into the cluster on the command-line.

- Change the directory to the root of the ArgoCD <Globals name="template" /> repo that was cloned previously.

- Run `igc git-secret gitops-cd-secret -n dev-{initials}` to create the secret. This command will prompt for the username,
personal access token, and the branch to put in the secret.

### What just happened?
    
- The `git-secret` command creates a secret in a kubernetes namespace containing the url, username, password, and branch information for a git repo. In the command above, we provided `gitops-cd-secret` for the secret name. (If that value is left off the secret name defaults to `{git org}.{git repo}`.) You can verify the secret was created by running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets/gitops-cd-secret -n dev-{initials} -o yaml
    ```

**Note:**
- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace
where the pipeline is running (e.g. `dev-{initials}`).
- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger
the CD pipeline. `test` is the recommended value for the branch field.

- Trigger the pipeline for the Inventory Management service to build by making a change
to the Inventory Management Service code and push the changes to Git.

### Repeat for BFF and UI components

Starting from [Configure the GitOps repo for Inventory Management service](#Configure-the-gitops-repo-for-inventory-management-service),
the steps need to be repeated for each application within the project.

## Securing the solution with **App ID**

To secure the application we are using the capabilities available within the IBMCloud platform that use
a simple annotation on the ingress to enable integration with AppId. The <Globals name="templates" /> have already been
set up to use this feature and all that is required is update the configuration within the `values.yaml`
file of the helm chart.

### Inventory Management UI

- Find the app id binding secret by running the following command from a terminal where the kubernetes context has been set up (i.e. `oc login` has been done)
    ```bash
    kubectl get -n dev secrets | grep -E "binding.*appid"
    ```

- Update the `values.yaml` file in the Inventory Management UI chart to set `ingress.appId.enabled=true` and to 
    set the value for the AppId binding secret from the previous step
    ```yaml path=/chart/template-node-react/values.yaml
    ...

    ingress:
      enabled: true
      appid:
        enabled: true
        # web or app - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-kube-auth
        requestType: web
        binding:
          name: "{binding secret}"
          namespace: dev
        ...
    ```

### AppId redirect url config

- Get the ingress for the UI component by running `igc ingress -n dev-{initials}`.

- Open the IBM Cloud resource list - `https://cloud.ibm.com/resources`

- Open the AppId instance to the `Manage Authentication` -> `Authentication Settings` view

    ![AppId authentication settings](images/appid-authentication-settings.png)

- Add the redirect url for the application to the web redirect URLs. The redirect url will have
the following form:

    `{ingress url}/appid_callback`
    
    e.g. `https://inventory-manangement-ui-dev.sms-test-oc-cluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/appid_callback`

### Add users to AppId

- Open the AppId instance to `Cloud Directory` -> `Users`

    ![AppId cloud directory users](images/appid-cloud-directory-users.png)

- Add yourself as a user with an email address, name, and password

### Access the UI

- Open a browser to the UI ingress

- You should be met with the AppId login screen. (This screen can be customized from the AppId service console but for now we are showing the default screen.)

- Provide the email address and password you configured in the previous steps. You should be granted access to the UI.


## Review Application End to End

Now that you have completed [Part 1](/practical/inventory-part1), and [Part 2](/practical/inventory-part1) you should review your application functionality end to end. This pattern for three tier applications is very common in the industry and being and hopefully you have learnt a lot of along the way of creating this Micro App.

## Summary

You have now completed the Micro App Guide demonstrating the _Inventory_ solution.
