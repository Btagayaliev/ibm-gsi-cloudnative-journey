However, because of the rapid and broad adoption of container orchestration on Kubernetes platforms across virtually all cloud providers, containerization is usually the better way to move applications to the cloud. At the highest level, containerize means to get the applications that you have today to run in a container.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you containerize an application, you’re focused on reducing costs, simplifying operations, and streamlining cloud migration to a common Kubernetes platform, such as Red Hat® OpenShift®. You’re also focused on moving toward a single operational model that can be used by both new cloud-native applications and traditional applications. By using the information from Transformation Advisor, you can decide at this phase whether the application can move to a modern, cloud-ready runtime such as IBM® WebSphere® Liberty. Such a move can require code changes and investment from the development team. You can also decide whether the application can move to a container that is based on traditional WebSphere without code changes.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expose on-premises assets by using APIs`}</h3>\n    <p>{`APIs enable assets that are difficult to enable for the cloud. By externalizing an application with an API, you allow new applications to use the exposed capability in an accessible way. Typically, this activity involves having an OpenAPI-specified REST interface that allows the interface to be discovered and managed. If you externalize the application early in the modernization lifecycle, you insulate consumers from further modernization activities that are done in pursuit of a complete cloud-native implementation.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Refactor the monolith into macroservices`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Refactoring means getting serious about the monolithic things and starting to transform them to become cloud native. Refactoring is where you tackle the huge Java™ and JavaScript files and break monoliths into smaller deployable components as suggested by the programming model.

Such modern application runtimes allow application containers to be more agile in terms of smaller runtime footprint and faster startup time. They also provide DevOps-oriented server configuration by using simple human-readable files and prebuilt integration points with common operational services such as logging, metrics, metering, health, and security. A few code changes are typically required to move applications from traditional WebSphere to Liberty.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For an end-to-end scenario that moves an application to the WebSphere Liberty runtime and runs it in Red Hat OpenShift, see `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/runtime-modernization-solution\"\n      }}>{`Runtime modernization by using WebSphere Liberty`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Containerizing a traditional WebSphere application for operational modernization`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Refactoring enterprise Java applications to WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty containers is your most strategic option.

You can reuse WebSphere automation scripting. If no such automation exists, you can use the configuration migration tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Pak for Applications to capture WebSphere environment configurations. Those tools create a separate DevOps pipeline for each application in the cell that is moved to a traditional WebSphere container.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For an end-to-end scenario that moves an application to the traditional WebSphere container and runs it in Red Hat OpenShift, see `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/op-modernization-solution\"\n      }}>{`Operational modernization by using traditional WebSphere`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
