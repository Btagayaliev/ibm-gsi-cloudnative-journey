The GSI team is looking for feedback from three perspectives:\n\n- **What went well?**\n- **What needs improvement?**\n- **Next steps?**\n\nDevelopers will begin the learning journey with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the Cloud Native enablement with a more detailed understanding of how to build solutions for the IBM Cloud. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the learning journey successfully.\n\n\n\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/mjperrins/projects/gsi/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/src/pages/enablement/developer-intermediate/index.mdx"}}}}
