Containers, Kubernetes, and microservices deliver speed and simplicity and are being adopted rapidly. But, your current estate determines your modernization strategy. Rewriting your entire application estate isn’t feasible, so modernization is inevitable.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Modernizing your applications provides a few immediate benefits:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Accelerating digital transformation.

It provides guidance on the right target application server and the amount of effort that is required to start the modernization journey.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Several factors determine an application’s path through the modernization phases and where it eventually finishes. Among those factors is the number of code changes that are required to move an application to a modern, cloud-ready application server and the business need for future investment in the application. The outcome of the analysis can help you select appropriate modernization patterns.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Review the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/application-modernization/reference-architecture\"\n      }}>{`Application modernization reference architecture`}</a>{` to understand which people, tools, and steps you might need on your journey.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Move the monolith to cloud`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Application migration to the cloud is often approached by using the VM-based “lift and shift” method. However, because of the rapid and broad adoption of container orchestration on Kubernetes platforms across virtually all cloud providers, containerization is usually the better way to move applications to the cloud. At the highest level, containerize means to get the applications that you have today to run in a container.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you containerize an application, you’re focused on reducing costs, simplifying operations, and streamlining cloud migration to a common Kubernetes platform, such as Red Hat® OpenShift®. You’re also focused on moving toward a single operational model that can be used by both new cloud-native applications and traditional applications. By using the information from Transformation Advisor, you can decide at this phase whether the application can move to a modern, cloud-ready runtime such as IBM® WebSphere® Liberty. Such a move can require code changes and investment from the development team. You can also decide whether the application can move to a container that is based on traditional WebSphere without code changes.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expose on-premises assets by using APIs`}</h3>\n    <p>{`APIs enable assets that are difficult to enable for the cloud. By externalizing an application with an API, you allow new applications to use the exposed capability in an accessible way. Typically, this activity involves having an OpenAPI-specified REST interface that allows the interface to be discovered and managed. If you externalize the application early in the modernization lifecycle, you insulate consumers from further modernization activities that are done in pursuit of a complete cloud-native implementation.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Refactor the monolith into macroservices`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Refactoring means getting serious about the monolithic things and starting to transform them to become cloud native. Refactoring is where you tackle the huge Java™ and JavaScript files and break monoliths into smaller deployable components as suggested by the programming model. These components are not fully independent microservices from an end-to-end delivery perspective. However, by using this approach, you can decouple modernization paths for individual macroservices and enable the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/chunking-strategy-strangler-pattern\"\n      }}>{`Strangler pattern`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Add capabilities as microservices`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Innovate incrementally and establish success early.
